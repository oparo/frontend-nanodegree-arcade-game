<h1>My Fabulous Recipe</h1>

<p>This recipe for <strong>cereal and milk</strong> has been passed down my family for months.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Cereal (you can find cool cereals <a href="www.example.com/coolcereals">here</a>)</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<p>If I were writing these out as <em>code</em>, it might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if bowl is empty:
    add cereal
if bowl only has cereal in it:
    add milk
</code></pre>

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
